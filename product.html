                <br><h4> Description </h4>
                <p style="justify"> Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase protein that is expressed in some epithelial, mesenchymal and neurogenic tissue.  Overexpression of EGFR has been reported to link to many tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Studies have shown that EGFR expression in NSCLC is associated with reduced survival, lymph node metastasis and decreased chemosensitivity.  EZLife Bio's EFIRM EGFR test kit allows for rapid direct detection of EGFR mutations directly from 20 uL biofluid specimen without purification and amplification steps.

                <h4> Test Overview </h4><br>
                <p style="justify"> Ezlife Bioâ€™s EFIRM EGFR kit is an EFIRM assay that uses mutation specific probes to identify the presence of three EGFR mutations.  The test workflow involves three simple steps which can be completed in approximately 2 hours from sample to answer:
                <ol>
                    <li><i>	Direct sample addition: </i> Apply just 20 ul of plasma or saliva sample into each well</li>
                    <li><i> Reporter enzyme addition:</i> Add prepackaged reporter enzymes to each well</li>
                    <li><i> Measurement using the EFIRM 96 EReader</i> Add an enzyme substrate and perform electrochemical readout in all wells in <2 minutes </li>
                   
                </ol>
