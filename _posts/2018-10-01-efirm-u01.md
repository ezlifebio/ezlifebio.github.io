NIH-NCI has recently awarded 5 million to UCLA in order to study EFIRM early stage lung cancer screening! This news was featured on the [UCLA Newsroom](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-awarded-5-million-to-develop-non-invasive-liquid-biopsy-tools-to-detect-lung-cancer-earlier-more-effectively)

This U01 is an academic industrial partnership between UCLA and EZLife Bio. EZLife Bio will provide critical support on all instrumentation development and automation development for the EFIRM platform. EZLife Bio's Dr. Wei Liao is a principal investigator, and Dr. Charles Strom and Dr. Michael Tu will function as co-investigators in the initiative. Together with UCLA, we hope to revolutionize lung cancer screening and add molecular testing to low-dose spiral CT testing.
