Three exciting new papers have been published on the EFIRM technology, again showing EFIRM's immense viability as a tool for liquid biopsy of cancer. 

## EFIRM for Monitoring of Lung Cancer Mutations

In a work spearheaded by Dr. Ning Li[1] in collaboration with the NIH/National Cancer Institute, EFIRM was used to monitor the PIK3CA gene variant in a lung cancer patients from saliva over 400 days. 

EFIRM was able to sensitively and accurate mirror the results of other technologies such as NGS and ddPCR. While other technologies require labor-intensive DNA extraction and amplification for measurement of PICK3CA variants, EFIRM is able to rapidly detect changes in the variant levels from a drop of saliva and plasma.
