EZLife has recently had its work in mitochondrial DNA profiling in meat samples published in the Analytical Chimica Acta.

As opposed to traditional technologies that require the meat to be homogenized, DNA extracted, and run on qPCR, the EFIRM technique is extremely simple, requiring only a simple immersion in an extraction liquid before testing on an EFIRM biosensor. The EFIRM technique is able to achieve sensitivity levels comparable to existing technologies, and doesn't need expensive antibodies like some existing meat profiling assays.
